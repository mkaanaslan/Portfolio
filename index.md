# Mustafa Kaan Aslan Portfolio

Hi! Welcome to my Github portfolio. I'm Kaan, senior Industrial Engineering student at Bogaziçi University, Istanbul. I am currently taking courses on operations research and data science with high enthusiasm in data analysis and machine learning. I am willing to have a career on data science. Here is listed some of the important elective courses I have taken from many respectable instructors in Bogazici University. Assignments and projects from those courses which I completed is available here both in "html" and "jupyter notebook" formats and some of them has contribution from project group members if it is a group project.  I am competent in both Python and R programming languages as a data scientist to be, but in the most of the assignments R is used.

## Senior Project - Personalized Dynamic Pricing in Agricultural Loan Applications
---
Project Advisor: Mustafa Gökçe Baydoğan
- Agricultural loan applications have a wide range of customer types and profit maximization is a very common topic in this area. Personalized dynamic pricing is one of the approaches to use in pricing strategies with the improvement in the data driven models. In this project, we propose different machine learning methods such as logistic regression, clustering methods, and model-based trees to learn the demand curves of different types of customers and segment the customers according to their price sensitivities. Then, the outputs are used to make a dynamic pricing strategy to reach the target of collected amount of money with high profitability. Our methodology dynamically prices the loans according to how close the target is. Finally, the models and the pricing strategy is tested by simulation.
